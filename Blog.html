          <h6>As the coronavirus outbreak has hit the United States for over a month as of now, the event seems to be further politicized and taken advantage of. Governments will fight 
            for the support of the masses which makes it necessary to understand the true threat in the years to come.</h6>
          <h6>The massive flaw of the 20th Century was a step away towards national independence and a step forward towards international amnesty. Democratic governments, and those in charge of them, have turned away from serving the interests of their own people, ethnically and nationally, and have opened their arms to the global free market. Instead of identifying towards a religious figure or a nation as an outlet for morality, people identify through their material wealth and the pandering of predator multinational corporations who further abuse the sovereignty of other countries.</h6>
          <h6>There is a double imperative here. As the leaders of the international world force transition towards international governance, there remains one country who stands above the rest. Those unbent towards the benefit of their own country have allowed others to adopt such a stance. One of those nations is China. </h6>
          <h6>It is interesting how China amassed such power. Just 40 years ago China was a struggling developing nation, and between the years 1995 and 2006, their GDP skyrocketed by 350%. As of now, China has the largest GDP by purchasing power parity in the world. Their wealth, however, was not self made. China continues to grow at the expense of their population - their relaxed labor laws permit child laborers and long abusing hours in difficult conditions. They have even began ethnically cleansing the Uighur Muslim minority near Eurasia as a means of preserving the Han Chinese race. Their influence in world politics has never been exposed until the recent Coronavirus outbreak. And it was handed to them. It is a fact that the coronavirus originated from the city of Wuhan out of their Institute of Virology. However, the World Health Organization continues to deny such claims. The majority of people would trust such an organization, but when reporters asked the World Health Organization about the status of coronavirus in Taiwan, they were ghosted, ignored, and even denied the existence of the nation.  </h6>
